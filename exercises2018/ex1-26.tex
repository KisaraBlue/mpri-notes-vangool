{\bf Exercise 1.26.}
\begin{enumerate}
\item For each of the lattices below, draw the poset of join-irreducibles.

\item For each of the posets drawn in (a), draw the distributive lattice of down-sets.

\item If the distributive lattice drawn in (b) is not isomorphic to the lattice you started from, then the original lattice must contain $M_3$ or $N_5$ as a sublattice without bounds. Why? 

\item Where applicable, find a sublattice $M_3$ or $N_5$ as described in (c).

\item Show that $K$ is a sublattice of $L$, and find the corresponding order preserving map between the dual posets.

\item Show that $M$ is a quotient of $K$, and find the corresponding order preserving map between the dual posets.
\end{enumerate}
